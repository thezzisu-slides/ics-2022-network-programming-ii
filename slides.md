# Outline

- **API**: The Sockets Interface
- **Spec**: The Web Servers
- **Idea**: Serving Dynamic Content
- **Demo**: The Tiny Web Server
- **Gossip**: Web Technologies and More

The beauty of computer systems lies in the **abstracting** between the ***interface*** and the ***implementation***.

This is especially true for **network programming**. From the top most Web Application Frameworks to the bottom most network hardwares, they all together bring us a colorful and complex world of *Internet*, while keeping the complexity hidden from not only end users, but also the developers.
